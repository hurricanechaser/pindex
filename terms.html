                <p>
                    Please read carefully the following terms and conditions. These Terms govern your
                    access to and use of the Site and Services and all Site Content (defined below),
                    and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and FreshPin.</p>
                <h3>
                    Key Terms related to Content</h3>
                <p>
                    " Content " means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, information
                    or other materials.</p>
                <p>
                    " FreshPin Content " means all Content that FreshPin makes available through the
                    Site or Service, including any Content licensed from a third party, but excluding
                    Member Content.</p>

                    " Member " means a person that completes FreshPin's account registration process,

                    " Member Content " means all Content that a Member posts, uploads, publishes, submits

                    Content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree
                    with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between
                    these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services,
                    Site Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect
                    to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Site Content.</p>
                <p>
                    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR SERVICES OR BY

                    YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR SITE CONTENT. If you accept
                    or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent
                    and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity
                    to these Terms and, in such event, " you " and " your " will refer and apply to
                    that company or other legal entity.</p>
                <h3>
                    Modification</h3>
                <p>
                    FreshPin reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate
                    the Site or Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice.
                    If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you
                    with notice of the modification. By continuing to access or use the Site or Services
                    after we have posted a modification on the Site or have provided you with notice
                    of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified
                    Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to
                    cease using the Site and the Services.</p>
                <h3>
                    Eligibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The Site and Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access
                    to or use of the Site or Services by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By
                    accessing or using the Site or Services you represent and warrant that you are 13
                    or older.</p>
                <h3>
                    Account Registration</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Member
                    Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account
                    ("Account"). You must register with FreshPin through your account with certain third
                    party social networking services, including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter
                    (collectively, "SNS"). When you register through your SNS account, you will be asked
                    to login to the Services using your SNS account credentials. Creating an Account
                    for the first time via a SNS will prompt you to merge your FreshPin and SNS accounts.
                    By creating an Account via your account with an SNS, you are allowing FreshPin to
                    access your SNS account information and you are agreeing to abide by the applicable
                    terms and conditions of your SNS in your use of the Services via such SNS. If you
                    are not currently registered as a Member and you click to login with an SNS, you
                    will first be asked to enter your SNS credentials and then be given the option to
                    register and join FreshPin. Members can automatically post recent activity back
                    to the applicable SNS, and Members also have the option to disable the connection
                    between their FreshPin Account and SNS account at any time by accessing the SNS
                    account and disconnecting access to the Services.</p>
                <p>
                    You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration
                    process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.
                    FreshPin reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information
                    provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate,
                    not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You
                    agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility
                    for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized
                    such activities or actions. You will immediately notify FreshPin of any unauthorized
                    use of your Account.</p>
                <h3>
                    Privacy</h3>

                    to sublicense, to access, view, download and print any FreshPin Content solely for
                    your personal and non-commercial purposes. You will not use, copy, adapt, modify,

                    Site, Services, or Site Content except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No
                    licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual
                    property rights owned or controlled by FreshPin or its licensors, except for the
                    licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>

                <p>
                    We may, in our sole discretion, permit Members to post, upload, publish, submit
                    or transmit Member Content. By making available any Member Content through the Site
                    or Services, you hereby grant to FreshPin a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive,
                    transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy,
                    adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform,
                    transmit, stream, broadcast, access, view, and otherwise exploit such Member Content
                    only on, through or by means of the Site or Services. FreshPin does not claim any
                    ownership rights in any such Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed
                    to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such Member Content.</p>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all Member Content
                    that you make available through the Site and Services. Accordingly, you represent
                    and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member
                    Content that you make available through the Site and Services or you have all rights,
                    licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to FreshPin the rights
                    in such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the
                    Member Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal
                    of the Member Content or FreshPin's use of the Member Content (or any portion thereof)
                    on, through or by means of the Site and the Services will infringe, misappropriate
                    or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights
                    or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or
                    privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

                    The failure of FreshPin to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
                    constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver
                    of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by
                    a duly authorized representative of FreshPin. Except as expressly set forth in these
                    Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will
                    be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for
                    any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
                    invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
                    permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
