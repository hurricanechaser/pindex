                    <strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies
                    - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer
                    that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to store certain information

                    We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains
                    after you close your browser. Your browser may use persistent cookies on subsequent
                    visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser
                    help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close
                    your browser.

                    features of the Website may not function properly or as intended if the ability
                    to accept cookies is disabled. Also, if you change your computer, change your Internet
                    browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you
                    will need to renew your preferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Log File Information.</strong> When you use the Website, our servers automatically
                    record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
                    These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
                    ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform
                    type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order
                    of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time
                    of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Clear GIFs Information.</strong> When you use the Website, we may employ
                    " clear GIFs " (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to anonymously track your online
                    usage patterns (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we
                    may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to you to track which emails are
                    opened by recipients.</p>
                <h3>
                    Use of Other Information</h3>
                <p>
                    You may invite others to become members. If you do, we will ask you for your friend's
                    email address. We automatically will send your friend an email inviting her or him
                    to visit the Website and join. We will not resend this invitation unless you specifically
                    request that we do so. We store the email information you have provided for the
                    sole purpose of sending this email and assessing elements of the invitation program.

                    segment (e.g., members 18-25 who have viewed certain content on the Website) and
                    if you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that

                    under the age of thirteen (13), and by using the Website or Service and/or registering
                    as a Member, you represent that you are not under the age of thirteen (13). Parents

                    The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, and
                    so we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of that information.
                    Without being exhaustive, some of those steps include: When you want to make a payment
                    to us, we do not take the payment processing information but instead direct you
                    to a third party payment processor that encrypts that information using secure socket
                    layer technology (SSL); we use measures to monitor and review account activity and
                    behavior in an effort to detect fraudulent activity or other anomalies; we also
                    allow you to choose privacy settings for certain social networking or other portions
                    of the Website.</p>

                    access to your personally identifiable information. You are responsible for and
                    should take steps to reduce the risk of disclosure of such identification names
                    or passwords, including, without limitation, using different passwords than you
                    use elsewhere, using strong passwords, and updating your antivirus software on a
                    regular basis.</p>
