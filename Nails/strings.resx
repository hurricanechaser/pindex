    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

                    TERMS OF USE&lt;/h1&gt;

If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services, Site Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Site Content.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR SERVICES OR BY POSTING ANY MEMBER CONTENT ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR SITE CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, " you " and " your " will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt; Modification&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    SiteName reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site or Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification.

If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and the Services.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Eligibility&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The Site and Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access to or use of the Site or Services by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site or Services you represent and warrant that you are 13 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Account Registration&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Member Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account  ("Account"). You must register with SiteName through your account with certain third party social networking services, including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter (collectively, "SNS"). When you register through your SNS account, you will be asked to login to the Services using your SNS account credentials. Creating an Account for the first time via a SNS will prompt you to merge your SiteName and SNS accounts. By creating an Account via your account with an SNS, you are allowing SiteName to access your SNS account information and you are agreeing to abide by the applicable terms and conditions of your SNS in your use of the Services via such SNS. If you are not currently registered as a Member and you click to login with an SNS, you  will first be asked to enter your SNS credentials and then be given the option to register and join SiteName. Members can automatically post recent activity back to the applicable SNS, and Members also have the option to disable the connection between their SiteName Account and SNS account at any time by accessing the SNS account and disconnecting access to the Services.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. SiteName reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify SiteName of any unauthorized use of your Account.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    See our Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="about.aspx#privacy"&gt;http://pinjimu.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for information and notices concerning SiteName's collection and use of your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    SiteName Content and Member Content License&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms, SiteName grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right  to sublicense, to access, view, download and print any SiteName Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Site, Services, or Site Content except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by SiteName or its censors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Member Content&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We may, in our sole discretion, permit Members to post, upload, publish, submit or transmit Member Content. By making available any Member Content through the Site or Services, you hereby grant to SiteName a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, access, view, and otherwise exploit such Member Content only on, through or by means of the Site or Services. SiteName does not claim any ownership rights in any such Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such Member Content.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all Member Content that you make available through the Site and Services. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available through the Site and Services or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to SiteName the rights in such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the Member Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Member Content or SiteName's use of the Member Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the Site and the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Site and Services ("Feedback"). You may submit Feedback through the "Contact Us" section of the Site. You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of SiteName and you hereby irrevocably assign to SiteName and agree to irrevocably assign to SiteName all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including without limitation all worldwide patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, moral rights and other proprietary or intellectual property rights therein.

                    We've taken the collective input of SiteName users and have laid down these guidelines that will help us keep the SiteName community positive, useful and clean.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Pins are the most useful when they have links back to the original source. If you notice that a pin is not sourced correctly, leave a comment so the original pinner can update the source. Finding the original source is always preferable to a secondary source such as Image Search or a blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                    We may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with third parties, including, as noted below, advertisers, advertising networks or advertising servers. However, we do not knowingly provide any personally identifiable information to any of these third parties without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out (see, e.g., the National Advertising Initiative ( " NAI " ) and the Digital Advertising Alliance ( " DAA " ) described below).
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We also may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving and other companies to serve or enable other sites to serve advertisements directly to you, and/or enable other services through the use of our Website, Service, and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set and trigger their own cookies, Web beacons and/or other technologies on your computer, which, in turn, may be used to tailor, report on, or analyze advertising seen on the Website and other websites. We do not have access to or control over these third-party cookies, beacons, or technologies. Nor are they covered by this Privacy Policy.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies or other companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s).

                &lt;p&gt;
                    While any personally identifiable information that you have chosen to disclose publically (whether through a Submission, use of your profile name, or otherwise) is available to others for their use and is entirely outside of our control, we will not share your personally identifiable information with third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have an ability to opt-in or opt-out using a commercially reasonable means.

                &lt;p&gt;
                    While we do not provide advertisers with personally identifiable information, except as permitted under this Privacy Policy, please note that if an advertiser has asked us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (e.g., women ages 18-25) or audience segment (e.g., members 18-25 who have viewed certain content on the Website) and if you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the audience or audience segment specified. An advertiser also may use information (but not any personally identifiable information) regarding your use of the Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad, to determine which additional ads to deliver to you.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    External Links&lt;/h3&gt;

                    Finally, this Website contains links to other third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we do not necessarily endorse and are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such " linked " websites, advertisers, ad networks or ad servers. You should familiarize yourself with their respective privacy policies prior to using any such third-party websites.&lt;/p&gt;

The Website and the Service are not directed at children under the age of thirteen (13), and by using the Website or Service and/or registering as a Member, you represent that you are not under the age of thirteen (13). Parents or legal guardians may not agree to the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or the disclosure of such child's personally identifiable information on such child's behalf. If we learn that we unknowingly have collected personally identifiable information of persons less than thirteen (13) years of age, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, and so we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of that information. Without being exhaustive, some of those steps include: When you want to make a payment to us, we do not take the payment processing information but instead direct you to a third party payment processor that encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL); we use measures to monitor and review account activity and behavior in an effort to detect fraudulent activity or other anomalies; we also allow you to choose privacy settings for certain social networking or other portions of the Website.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is perfect or 100% secure. Nor can we control the actions of other users or members with whom you share your information or to whom you make your information publicly available. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide through your use of this Website, including without limitation, no guarantee that only authorized people will view your information and that the information may not be disclosed, accessed, altered, become publicly available, or even destroyed. You agree that you provide information at your own risk and specifically release us from any liability related in any way to such information or breach of security.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Likewise, we are not responsible for any third party violations or efforts to circumvent any privacy settings or security measures on the Website. Any user identification names or passwords you use (whether provided by you or us) shall be maintained by you as confidential and should not be shared with anyone not authorized to have access to your personally identifiable information. You are responsible for and should take steps to reduce the risk of disclosure of such identification names or passwords, including, without limitation, using different passwords than you use elsewhere, using strong passwords, and updating your antivirus software on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We reserve the right to take any action with respect to information posted on the Website, including, but not limited to, taking down information or other materials and terminating your Membership and rights of use.

                    We also use the account information to determine eligibility for or make certain features or services available to members. Therefore, if there are errors in the account information or your personally identifiable information changes or needs to be updated, you are responsible for making the needed corrections or updates and should do so through the My Account section of the Website.&lt;/p&gt;

                    What is SiteName?&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    SiteName is a stream of images from over 450 curated sites. It is a simple and
                    convenient way to find new content for your stylebook or pinboard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We started SiteName because we wanted an easier way to get new ideas onto our pinboards.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    We simply wanted fresh content from original sources. So we built SiteName.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    With SiteName you only browse unique images, filtered and sorted the way you want
                    them. We try to eliminate all duplicates to save your time. Since most of our content
                    comes from the original source it is easy to trace back. SiteName is a fun way
                    to quickly discover new things.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;
                    What Can You Do Differently with SiteName?&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Pin Leader&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Seeing the latest content can help you chose inspiring things that others in your
                    community may not have seen. New content is a great way to contribute to your community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Shop-Pin&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Our showrooms only show products that have been crowd sourced, so it helps you find
                    high quality products quickly. These are usually the most fashionable items that
                    the stores carry.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Choose a mini-cause to support and promote. Your group of friends can all chip in
                    and make a difference. Caring matters.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;
                    Our Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Umm.... Our mission is to make it easier to create inspiring pinboards! Ok, nobody
                    is going to make a movie about how we went about shapin the world. We do not know
                    where this hobby will lead, so let's have fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;p&gt; SiteName is a stream of images from over 450 curated sites. It is a simple and convenient
    way to find new content for your stylebook or pinboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We started SiteName because we wanted an easier way to get new ideas onto our pinboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We simply wanted fresh content from original sources. So we built SiteName.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With SiteName you only browse unique images, filtered and sorted the way you want
    them. We try to eliminate all duplicates to save your time. Since most of our content
    comes from the original source it is easy to trace back. SiteName is a fun way to
    quickly discover new things.&lt;/p&gt;   

&lt;h3&gt;What is a pin?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A pin is an image that someone has added in any one of the source sites. You can
    browse through these images and quickly find new content for your own style or pinboard.
    To see the source of the pin, you can just mouse over the image.&lt;/p&gt;                            

&lt;h3&gt;Why do you have the icons when you mouse over the image?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; SiteName bring you the most recent images from over 450 sources that you can use
    to create your own boards on SiteName or on any of your favorite virtual boards.
    If you see an image you like, just click on the icon and you'll be able to pin the
    image to your board in Pinterest, Tumblr, Lockerz or Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
                           
&lt;h3&gt;What are the two links displayed when you mouse over the image?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When you mouse over any image in SiteName, you will see two links. The first link
    is the source the image is from. Clicking on this link will take you to the image
    in the source site. The second link is the category the image has been placed under
    in SiteName. Clicking on this will take you to the SiteName board for that category.
